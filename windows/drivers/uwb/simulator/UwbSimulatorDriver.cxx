 * @brief DriverEntry initializes the driver and is the first routine called by
 * the system after the driver is loaded. DriverEntry specifies the other entry
 * points in the function driver, such as EvtDevice and DriverUnload.
 *
 * @param driverObject Represents the instance of the function driver that is
 * loaded into memory. DriverEntry must initialize members of DriverObject
 * before it returns to the caller. DriverObject is allocated by the system
 * before the driver is loaded, and it is released by the system after the
 * system unloads the function driver from memory.
 * @param registryPath Represents the driver specific path in the Registry. The
 * function driver can use the path to store driver related data between
 * reboots. The path does not store hardware instance specific data.
 * @return NTSTATUS STATUS_SUCCESS if successful, STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL otherwise.
