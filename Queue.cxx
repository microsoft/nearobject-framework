UwbSimulatorQueueInitialize(WDFDEVICE device)

Routine Description:

     The I/O dispatch callbacks for the frameworks device object
     are configured in this function.

     A single default I/O Queue is configured for parallel request
     processing, and a driver context memory allocation is created
     to hold our structure QUEUE_CONTEXT.

Arguments:

    Device - Handle to a framework device object.

Return Value:

    NTSTATUS

Routine Description:

    //
    // In most cases, the EvtIoStop callback function completes, cancels, or postpones
    // further processing of the I/O request.
    //
    // Typically, the driver uses the following rules:
    //
    // - If the driver owns the I/O request, it calls WdfRequestUnmarkCancelable
    //   (if the request is cancelable) and either calls WdfRequestStopAcknowledge
    //   with a Requeue value of TRUE, or it calls WdfRequestComplete with a
    //   completion status value of STATUS_SUCCESS or STATUS_CANCELLED.
    //
    //   Before it can call these methods safely, the driver must make sure that
    //   its implementation of EvtIoStop has exclusive access to the request.
    //
    //   In order to do that, the driver must synchronize access to the request
    //   to prevent other threads from manipulating the request concurrently.
    //   The synchronization method you choose will depend on your driver's design.
    //
    //   For example, if the request is held in a shared context, the EvtIoStop callback
    //   might acquire an internal driver lock, take the request from the shared context,
    //   and then release the lock. At this point, the EvtIoStop callback owns the request
    //   and can safely complete or requeue the request.
    //
    // - If the driver has forwarded the I/O request to an I/O target, it either calls
    //   WdfRequestCancelSentRequest to attempt to cancel the request, or it postpones
    //   further processing of the request and calls WdfRequestStopAcknowledge with
    //   a Requeue value of FALSE.
    //
    // A driver might choose to take no action in EvtIoStop for requests that are
    // guaranteed to complete in a small amount of time.
    //
    // In this case, the framework waits until the specified request is complete
    // before moving the device (or system) to a lower power state or removing the device.
    // Potentially, this inaction can prevent a system from entering its hibernation state
    // or another low system power state. In extreme cases, it can cause the system
    // to crash with bugcheck code 9F.
